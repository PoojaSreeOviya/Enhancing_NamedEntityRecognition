## üßæ Abstract

Named Entity Recognition (NER) plays a critical role in many NLP tasks such as information extraction, question answering, and text summarization. This project explores techniques to improve NER performance using hybrid deep learning models. We evaluate different architectures and training strategies to achieve enhanced entity recognition on standard datasets.
